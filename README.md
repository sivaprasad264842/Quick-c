# Quick-C 


QuickC – Full-Stack E-Commerce Platform with Secure Authentication
A modern, responsive clothing e-commerce web application built with React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query on the frontend, powered by a Node.js/Express + MongoDB backend. Features include product browsing with category filtering, a fully functional cart, Razorpay payment integration, real-time order tracking via WebSocket (STOMP), and a complete user authentication flow: email/password signup, password confirmation, email verification (Nodemailer), and JWT-based secure login. After successful email verification, users are redirected to the login page and, upon login, land on the stylish QuickC homepage. The codebase follows clean architecture, uses modern React Query v5 patterns for data fetching/mutations, and is ready for deployment on Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend). Perfect showcase of end-to-end full-stack development, secure auth implementation, payment gateway integration, and real-time features.
